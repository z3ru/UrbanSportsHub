Urban Sports Hub is a partial clone of the Urban Sports Club app, built to demonstrate its functionality and highlight a critical security flaw in the check-in process.

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only. It is intended to showcase a security vulnerability in the Urban Sports Club check-in process and suggest improvements. It should not be used for fraudulent activities.

## Features

- **Course Listing**: Browse a list of sports venues and available classes.
- **Check-in System**: Users can check in to a class and see their check-in details.
- **Profile Management**: Users can upload a profile picture and edit their name & member ID.
- **Persistent Data**: User data are saved in local storage for persistence and seamless experience.
- **Dark Mode Support**: The app adapts to the user's preferred theme.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **UI & Styling**: CSS, Swiper.js for carousels
- **Backend (Planned)**: Firebase (for storing class data)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Screenshots

Coming soon!

# Security Flaw in the Urban Sports Club Check-In Process

## Introduction

Urban Sports Club offers a flexible membership that allows users to access a wide range of sports venues across multiple cities. To enter a venue, users must complete a check-in process via the official app. However, the current method of validating check-ins presents a critical security flaw that could be exploited by fraudulent users.

## How the Current Check-In Process Works

1. **User Scans a QR Code**: Upon arriving at a sports venue, the user scans a QR code provided by the venue.
2. **App Validates Membership**: The Urban Sports Club app checks whether the user meets all necessary requirements, including:
   - An active and valid membership
   - Available check-ins for the day
3. **Successful Check-In Confirmation**: If all conditions are met, the app displays a confirmation overlay that signals a successful check-in.
4. **Manual Verification by Staff**: The venue staff visually inspects the check-in confirmation on the user’s device. A valid check-in should include:
   - The member’s profile picture
   - A green confirmation dialog box
   - A moving circle around the profile picture
   - The name of the class or venue
   - The check-in date and time
   - A time counter since check-in
5. **Entry Granted**: If everything appears correct, the staff allows the user to enter the venue.

## The Security Flaw

The primary issue with this check-in system is that it relies entirely on a **visual verification method**. A fraudulent user could exploit this by using a cloned app that generates a fake check-in overlay identical to the original one. This means:

- The staff at the venue would be unable to differentiate between a legitimate check-in and a fake one.
- Since there is no backend verification on the venue’s side, a fake check-in cannot be detected.
- Fraudulent users could gain unauthorized access without a valid membership.

## Demonstration of the Issue

To highlight this security flaw, I developed a **clone of the Urban Sports Club app** called **Urban Sports Hub**. This app mimics the check-in process and generates an overlay that looks identical to a real check-in screen. While this project was created for educational purposes only, it demonstrates how easily the current system could be bypassed.

## A More Secure Check-In Solution

A better approach to handling check-ins would involve **QR code-based verification by the venue** instead of relying on a visual check. Here’s how it should work:

1. **User Receives a Unique QR Code**: Instead of displaying a confirmation screen, the app should generate a unique QR code representing the user’s valid membership.
2. **Venue Scans the QR Code**: The venue staff should use a scanner or a dedicated Urban Sports Club terminal to verify the user’s membership in real-time.
3. **Backend Authentication**: The system should check the user’s membership status, remaining check-ins, and validity directly with Urban Sports Club’s backend.
4. **Entry Decision**: If the check-in is valid, the system grants access and logs the event securely.

## Conclusion

The current check-in system used by Urban Sports Club is highly vulnerable to fraud due to its reliance on manual visual verification. A more secure solution, where venues scan user-generated QR codes, would ensure that only legitimate check-ins are honored. This change would significantly improve security and prevent unauthorized access, benefiting both the company and its partner venues.

By identifying this security gap, we can push for improvements that ensure a fair and trustworthy check-in process for all members.
